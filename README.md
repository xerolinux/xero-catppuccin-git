### This is XeroLinux's Catppuccin Rice

### Disclosure

> I would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. We use custom themes in every one of our rices, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of our hands.

-> Performance :

> This rice as with all rices has been throughly optimized for best performance.. If you have issues, kindly report them on our socials, Telegram/Discord.. we will try our best to help...

# Installation

Just clone this repository, run terminal inside directory and run installer Script using below command.

`git clone https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-catppuccin-git && cd xero-catppuccin-git && ./install.sh`

### Support

Since I wasn't the one who worked on this rice alone, with the majority of the work, especially the wallpaper, Grub and overall consistency which were all done by my good friend and brother [@TeddyBearKilla](https://github.com/TeddyBearKilla), please feel free to show him some love by buying him a coffee or two on [**Ko-Fi**](https://ko-fi.com/teddybearkilla)

### Reminder

Please follow the script instructions and answer some prompts with `y` when asked, if any, and select the right option for others. You might see a few errors pop up here n there, ignore them and let it do its thing. Once script is done your are urged to save any work you are doing and reboot for rice to be loaded and applied. Keep in mind that it will backup some app settings & all system ones before applying and overriding them with new ones, you will be able to restore what you need from the backup, so please do not report that. You have been warned. In case of any issues please find us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Xg6T78ahtK). Best of luck !

### Applying Theme/Rice Updates

When you initially apply the rice, you will be getting latest theme/rice code in straight from source, but in case there are updates to the underlying themes or rice itself, as I keep applying various optimizations, and want to apply them, well, that will be difficult without having to re-apply the rice, which will replace any and/or all your own modifications should you have applied any. Unfortunately it is what it is. Only do it if and when you feel confident enough and know how to restore your settings from backup afterwards. Sorry about that. I hope that covers that lol ;)

## Script will do the following steps :

- Create a backup of your ~/.config folder.
- Download and install necessary packages if needed...
- Override your settings and files with this rice's.
- Install and apply New Grub Theme...

# F.A.Q
