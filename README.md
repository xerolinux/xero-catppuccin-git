### This is XeroLinux's Catppuccin Rice

### Disclosure

> I would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. We use custom themes in every one of our rices, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of our hands. In case that happens, kindly report back, we will check with them for any fixes/updates, if none are available, we will have no choice but to archive affected rice, and hide it, until fixes are applied and themes updated...

-> Some notes before proceeding :

> Applying this rice will override all your settings. So make sure to create a backup of your system either via Snapper if using it, or TimeShift. Don't worry though, script will attempt to create a backup for you of your ~/.config folder before proceeding. Still better be safe than sorry.

-> Performance :

> This rice as with all rices has been throughly optimized for best performance.. If you have issues, kindly report them on our socials, Telegram/Discord.. we will try our best to help...
